\title{score_pptq: Scored data from the Pictorial Personality Traits Questionnaire for Children}
\usage{
score_pptq(pptq_data, pptq_scale, base_zero = TRUE, id, extra_scale_cols = c())
}
\arguments{
\item{pptq_data}{a data.frame all items for the Pictorial Personality Traits Questionnaire for Children  following the naming conventions described above}

\item{pptq_scale}{3 or 5: indicates if data was collected with a 3-point or 5-point likert scale}

\item{base_zero}{the smallest value assigned to a choice is 0 (i.e., range 0-3). Default = TRUE.}

\item{id}{(optional) name of participant ID column in bes_data. If included the output dataset will be matched by id, if not included the output dataset will be in the order of bes_data but will have no participant identifier. Required to get the phenotype dataset (raw data merged with scores.)}

\item{extra_scale_cols}{a vector of character strings that begin with 'pptq' but are not scale items. Any columns in pptq_data that begin with 'pptq' but are not scale items must be included here. Default is empty vector.}
