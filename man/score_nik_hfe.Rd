\title{score_nik_hfe: Scored data from the Home Food Environment Survey from the Neighborhood Impact on Kids Study}
\usage{
score_nik_hfe(hfe_data, base_zero = TRUE, id, extra_scale_cols = c())
}
\arguments{
\item{hfe_data}{a data.frame all items for the Home Food Environment Survey from the Neighborhood Impact on Kids Study following the naming conventions described above}

\item{base_zero}{(logical) TRUE indicates the smallest value assigned to a choice is 0. FALSE indicates indicates the smallest value assigned to a choice is 1. Default = TRUE.}

\item{id}{(optional) name of participant ID column in input data. If included, the output dataset will be matched by id, if not included the output dataset will be in the order of the input data but will have no participant identifier. Required to get the phenotype dataset (raw data merged with scores.)}

\item{extra_scale_cols}{a vector of character strings that begin with 'hfe' but are not scale items. Any columns in hfe_data that begin with 'hfe' but are not scale items must be included here. Default is empty vector.}
}
\value{
A dataset with subscale scores for the Home Food Environment Survey from the Neighborhood Impact on Kids Study
