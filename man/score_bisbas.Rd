\title{score_bisbas: Scored data from the Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System}
\usage{
score_bisbas(bisbas_data, base_zero = TRUE, id, extra_scale_cols = c())
}
\arguments{
\item{bisbas_data}{a data.frame all items for the Behavioral Inhibition Scale/Behavioral Activation Scale following the naming conventions described above}

\item{base_zero}{(logical) TRUE indicates the smallest value assigned to a choice is 0. FALSE indicates indicates the smallest value assigned to a choice is 1. Default = TRUE.}

\item{id}{(optional) name of participant ID column in input data. If included, the output dataset will be matched by id, if not included the output dataset will be in the order of the input data but will have no participant identifier. Required to get the phenotype dataset (raw data merged with scores.)}

\item{extra_scale_cols}{a vector of character strings that begin with 'bisbas' but are not scale items. Any columns in bisbas_data that begin with 'bisbas' but are not scale items must be included here. Default is empty vector.}
}
\value{
A dataset with subscale scores for the Behavioral Inhibition Scale/Behavioral Activation Scale
}
\description{
This function scores the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS)/Behavioral Activation System (BAS) and provides subscale scores for the following behaviors: BIS, BAS Fun Seeking, BAS Drive, and BAS Reward Responsiveness. Note, this script is used to score the 24-item version, which contains 4 filler questions that are not used for scoring. While the scored questions match the 20-item version exactly, the question numbers differ so this script cannot be sued to score the 20-item version at this time. If this functionality is desired, contact the kellertools package developers.

\details{
#' For data to be scored correctly, the data must be prepared according to the following criteria: \cr
\itemize{
 \item{The data must include all individual questionnaire items}
 \item{The columns/variables must match the following naming convention: 'bisbas#' or 'bisbas_#' where # is the question number (1-24)}
 \item{All questionnaire responses must be a numeric value ranging from 0-3 (base_zero = TRUE) or 1-4 (base_zero = FALSE) where: }
 \itemize{
    \item{For base_zero = TRUE: 0 = Very True for Me; 1 = Somewhat True for Me; 2 = Somewhat False for Me; 3 = Very False for Me}
    \item{For base_zero = FALSE: 1 = Very True for Me; 2 = Somewhat True for Me; 3 = Somewhat False for Me; 4 = Very False for Me}
  }
 \item{Missing values must be coded as NA}
 \item{Values must not be reversed scored. This script will apply reverse scoring so all levels must be true to the scale described above}
}
\cr
Note, as long as variable names match those listed, the dataset can include other variables
