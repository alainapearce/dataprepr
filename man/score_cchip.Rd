\title{score_cchip: Scored data from the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project}
\usage{
score_cchip(cchip_data, id, extra_scale_cols = c())
}
\arguments{
\item{cchip_data}{a data.frame all items for the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project following the naming conventions described above}

\item{id}{(optional) name of participant ID column in bes_data. If included the output dataset will be matched by id, if not included the output dataset will be in the order of bes_data but will have no participant identifier. Required to get the phenotype dataset (raw data merged with scores.)}

\item{extra_scale_cols}{a vector of character strings that begin with 'cchip' but are not scale items. Any columns in cchip_data that begin with 'cchip' but are not scale items must be included here. Default is empty vector.}
}
\value{
A dataset with scores for the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project
}
\description{
This function scores the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project and provides an overall CCHIP Score and Food Insecurity Status
}
\details{
To use this function, the data must be prepared according to the following criteria:
1) The data must include all individual questionnaire items
2) The  columns/variables must match the following naming convention: 'cchip#' or 'cchip_#' where # is question number. For the Food and Brain Study, the 8 primary questions needed are: cchip1, cchip5, cchip9, cchip13, cchip17, cchip21, cchip25, and cchip29. Can be adapted to processes other data/studies in the future.
3) The primary indicatory questions must have the following numeric values: Yes - 1, No - 0

Note, as long as variable names match those listed, the dataset can include other variables
